#pragma mark Background Colors

/**

* main background, farthest back. Secondary and tertiary colors are layered on top
* of the main background, when appropriate.
*
* Inside of a discrete piece of UI, choose a stack, then use colors from that stack.
* Apple does not recommend mixing and matching background colors between stacks.
* The foreground colors above are designed to work in both stacks.
*
* 1. systemBackground
*    Use this stack for views with standard table views, and designs which have a white
*    primary background in light mode.
